    allows you to write things and also set variables without displaying the containted
    text. Morevoer, it eliminates all line breaks between nobr and endnobr. \r\n<<endnobr>>\r\n\r\nRain
    falls and thunder claps. Gallops echo in the distance as you run through the forest.
    Footsteps splash in the mud.The glow of a small inn draws nearer. \r\n\r\nWalk

    take the orb. Its glow softly illuminates the room. \r\n\r\nYou open the window,
    and hurl the orb into the darkness outside.\r\n\r\nAs you shut the window...\r\n\r\nSLAM!
    Your door flies open. Several soldiers are at the entrance.\r\n\r\n\"Stop! There
    is a thief among us. Let us see your bag, traveler!\"\r\n\r\nTwo soldiers advance
    and seize your bag before you can move, dumping its contents on the ground. The
    dagger and coins clink on the ground. \r\n\r\n\"Nothing sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that
    is a pecuilar dagger, you must be from distant lands.\" \r\n\r\nThe soldier picks
    up one of the coins and pockets it, flashing a toothy grin.\r\n\r\n\"For the common
    good. Stay safe, outlander.\"\r\n\r\nThe soldiers leave and storm the next room,
    causing a woman to scream. \r\n\r\nYou climb out the window, and find the faintly
    glowing orb. It's only a matter of time before they get close again, but you're
    so close to the port... \r\n\r\nThunder claps and rain begins to fall.\r\n<<else>>\r\nYou
    take the orb. The soldier's face shines with glee as he draws his sword.\r\n\r\n\"I've
    found-\"\r\n\r\nYou use the power of the orb to stop time. \r\n\r\nYou didn't
    want to use its full power but there was no other choice. \r\n\r\nYou grab your
    dagger and slit the throat of every guard in the building. The human body behaves
    in such a bizaree manner when time stands still. On your way back out you release
    the orb's power, and the thud of 30 bodies provide a soft boom in the forest.
    Screams follow.\r\n\r\nThere won't be anyone following you, but too many people
    saw you. Perhaps you should have killed them all. But killing the innocent weighs
    on you. You continue through the forest, ever so close to the end of your journey.

    dagger\r\n<<if $tavern_action is \"no\">>You draw your dagger and stand at the

    entrance.\r\n\r\n\"Sto-\"\r\n\r\nYou slice his throat before he can speak another
    word. As one soldier falls, your blade is already in the heart of another. You
    draw the second soldier's blade as he falls and slice the necks of the remaining
    two soldier's at once. \r\n\r\n4 bodies are slumped on the floor, bleeding.\r\n\r\nAll
    is quiet upstairs for a moment.\r\n\r\nYou open the window in the room and steal
    off into the night. As you look back, you see several more soldiers enter your
    room, peering out. Their voices carry across the forest.\r\n\r\n\"You can't run
    forever!\"\r\n\r\nYou place your bloody dagger into the bag, no time to clean
    it. The orb inside the bag glows faintly. This orb has drawn the wrath of an army.
    It's only a matter of time before they get close again, but you're so close to
    the port...\r\n\r\nThunder claps and rain begins to fall.\r\n<<else>>\r\nYou draw
    your dagger and the soldier begins to swing at you with his sword. \r\n\r\nYou
    slit his throat and swiftly move through the crowd. Another slice, another burst
    of blood. A body hits the ground. You jump through a window, running full sprint
    into the dark forest.\r\n\r\n\"Thief! You can't run forever!\"\r\n\r\nYou ascend
    a tree with ease, hiding beyond the range of a torch.\r\n\r\nFootsteps and gallops
    move throught the forest.\r\n\r\n\"The thief must have gotten back on the trade
    road, it's the only way to the port!\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps you should have used the
    orb's power. Perhaps you should have killed them all. At least the soldiers. Killing
    the innocent weighs on you though. You are ever so close to the end of your journey,

    of a clock until the soldiers reach the end of the hallway. \r\n\r\n\"There's
    nothing up here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well we did manage to find some gold from these generous

    the music returns and the tavern enters full swing once again. You emerge from
    the barrel, drink an entire flagon of port and enjoy the company of the talented
    bard that night. The journey can continue come morrow.\r\n\r\nNobody ever looks
    in a barrel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
